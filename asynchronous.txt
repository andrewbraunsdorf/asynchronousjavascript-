Asynchronous code can start something now and finish it laterâ€¦
Written by twitter, fb, youtube, soundcloud.

Synchronous JS
JavaScript code runs on a single thread (can do 1 thing at a time)
Synchronous code waits for 1 action to complete before moving on to the next
Var article = readSync(article_loc);
console.log(article);
Var authors = readSync(authors_loc);
console.log(authors);

If 10 seconds long to load article_loc, you cant run JS in the mean time.

Asynchronous JS
readAsync(article_loc, function(){
console.log(article);
});
readAsync(authors_loc, function(){
console.log(authors);
});
Request where it will get data and carry on
Frees up to move onto other things

JavaScripts- makes a queue when it first reads your file

Synchronous Code goes in order and files in order to fire the function it needs to do.
Callbacks-Good
Promises-better
Generators-awesome
